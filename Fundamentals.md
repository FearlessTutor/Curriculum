# Fundamentals

- Develop a hands on experience with the Linux OS and Unix toolchain: Distributions, Bash, VIM, file (r/w/perms, dirs, symlinks), Git, networking, CURL, packages (apt-get), SSH, SELinux

- Exercises to demonstrate knowledge

## Lesson 1

Lesson Points

- Exchange email addresses

Homework

- Play with the 6 commands
- If you have any questions, write them in VIM questions.txt of your home dir and save them for later
- Explore the filesystem and see if you can figure out what they might do. Inspect at least 5 files and (writing in VIM) explain your best guess of what you think they might be related to.

## Lesson 2

Homework Review

- What did you do with the four commands? Any questions?
- What files did you find? What's your best guess of their use? Did you read the man page?
